# 🚀 Ghostfolio MVP

Ghostfolio is an **interactive learning platform** that reimagines how junior developers build projects.  
Think *Duolingo for coding* — where each project is broken down into guided tasks and steps, complete with progress tracking and code previews.

This MVP demonstrates the **core experience**: selecting a project, following structured tasks, marking progress, and returning later to pick up where you left off.

## 🎯 Vision

Software engineering is best learned by building real things.  
Ghostfolio’s mission is to **accelerate developer growth** by combining:

- ✅ **Structured, bite-sized tasks** → clear roadmap for projects  
- ✅ **Immediate feedback** → track progress and stay motivated  
- ✅ **Portfolio-ready outcomes** → every project builds towards a showcaseable skillset  

This MVP is the foundation for a future SaaS platform where learning meets entrepreneurship.
